Prerequisites
A best practice is to run your project locally before you deploy it. To run your project locally, you need the following installed on your computer:

Node.js.

The Angular CLI. From the terminal, install the Angular CLI globally with: 
    npm install -g @angular/cli

With the Angular CLI, you can use the command ng to create new workspaces, new projects, serve your application during development, or produce builds to share or distribute.


Running your application locally
1. Download the project and change directory to the newly downloaded project
2. To download and install npm packages, use the following npm CLI command: npm install
3. Use the following CLI command to run your application locally: ng serve
4. To see your application in the browser, go to http://localhost:4200/. If the default port 4200 is not available, you can specify another port with the port flag as in the following example: ng serve --port 4201
5. To stop the ng serve command, press Ctrl+c.
